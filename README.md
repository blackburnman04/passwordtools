# Password Tools

Description: A basic Python script/program using Tkinter that allows users to perform the following functions:

1.Generate a single random password
2.Generate a number of passwords specified by the user of a certain length specified by the user to a text file in a location of their choice
3.Test the strength of a password that is inputted by the user.
4.Test the strength of a text file selected by the user containing passwords (the text file created by the program/script in feature 2 would be ideal to test).

I am a beginner programmer with Python so this is likely to contain possible bugs and the logic of the program may be flawed in general.

I hope to improve my skills as time goes on and create more challenging and useful scripts/program.


Imports used:

tkinter
random
os

I hope to add extra features soon to this script/program such as:

- The ability to copy the generated password in step 1 to clipboard
- Connection to exposed password api to check if the generated password has appeared in any leaks

If anyone would like to contact me regarding ways in which the script/program could be greatly improved, feel free to do so on the email above. 
I would be more than happy to be given advice and ways to improve from developers.
